User registers and opens an account and at the same time, user also chooses a user name and password. One user opens an account, he is provided with a account number by the BANK. The Bank only should generate an account number which is used to link with his account information.
So, everytime (after the user has opened an account and registered with the bank) ,
The user has to login. The user activity should be displayed.
Then the user can make transactions.  
SO, TO MAKE TRANSACTIONS AND TO CLOSE THE ACCOUNT, USER HAS TO LOGIN. If not logged in, these two features should be locked.
On closing account, the row should be deleted from customer and cascaded to all the rows.
On making transaction, the row should be updated in transaction and  balance should be updated in all the rows.
On opening account, account number should be generated.
Dates should be given as sysdate when required.)
